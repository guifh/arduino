Welcome to Arduino Projects.

This is a website presenting small do-it-yourself projects with [Arduino
UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/). My friend Jacob and I wanted to do high
quality macro-photography. For that purpose, we needed a system to
automatically take multiple photos focused on different regions of the
subject. That's how it all started: our first project is a basic camera
focus stacking controller for high quality macro-photography. We are
planning to improve it and tune it up in future posts.

Codes (written in C\#) are freely available on the our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/guifh/arduino). For info, this website
was written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and
published with [Jekyll (Hyde theme)](http://hyde.getpoole.com/).

Thanks for reading!
