Welcome to Arduino Projects.

This is a website presenting small do-it-yourself projects with [Arduino
UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/). Our first project is a basic camera
focus stacking controller for high quality macro-photography. We are
planning to improve it and tune it up in future posts.

Codes (written in C#) are available (under an MIT license) on the our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/guifh/arduino). This website was written in Rmarkdown
and published with Jekyll (Hyde theme).

Thanks for reading!
